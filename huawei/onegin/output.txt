''All my offences that abroad you see
''Among the many that mine eyes have seen,
''And, lo, behold these talents of their hair,
''But, O my sweet, what labour is't to leave
''How mighty then you are, O, hear me tell!
''Lo, all these trophies of affections hot,
''Lo, this device was sent me from a nun,
''Look here, what tributes wounded fancies sent me,
''My parts had power to charm a sacred nun,
''Now all these hearts that do on mine depend,
''O, pardon me, in that my boast is true:
''O, then, advance of yours that phraseless hand,
''The diamond,--why, 'twas beautiful and hard,
''When thou impressest, what are precepts worth
'And long upon these terms I held my city,
'But quickly on this side the verdict went:
'But, ah, who ever shunn'd by precedent
'But, woe is me! too early I attended
'Father,' she says, 'though in me you behold
'For further I could say 'This man's untrue,'
'For, lo, his passion, but an art of craft,
'gainst shame,
'His browny locks did hang in crooked curls;
'His qualities were beauteous as his form,
'In him a plenitude of subtle matter,
'Many there were that did his picture get,
'Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood,
'O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies
'O, that infected moisture of his eye,
'Small show of man was yet upon his chin;
'So many have, that never touch'd his hand,
'So on the tip of his subduing tongue
'That he did in the general bosom reign
'That horse his mettle from his rider takes:
'That not a heart which in his level came
'This said, his watery eyes he did dismount,
'Thus merely with the garment of a Grace
'Tis promised in the charity of age.
'Well could he ride, and often men would say
'Yet did I not, as some my equals did,
A plaintful story from a sistering vale,
A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh--
A thousand favours from a maund she drew
A youthful suit--it was to gain my grace--
Accomplish'd in himself, not in his case:
Against the thing he sought he would exclaim;
All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,
All kinds of arguments and question deep,
All melting; though our drops this difference bore,
All replication prompt, and reason strong,
All vows and consecrations giving place:
And bastards of his foul adulterate heart.
And be not of my holy vows afraid:
And comely-distant sits he by her side;
And controversy hence a question takes,
And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath
And deep-brain'd sonnets that did amplify
And dialogued for him what he would say,
And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale;
And every light occasion of the wind
And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling;
And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them
And makes her absence valiant, not her might.
And mine I pour your ocean all among:
And new pervert a reconciled maid!' 
And nice affections wavering stood in doubt
And now she would the caged cloister fly:
And now, to tempt, all liberty procured.
And often kiss'd, and often 'gan to tear:
And often reading what contents it bears;
And reign'd, commanding in his monarchy.
And so much less of shame in me remains,
And supplicant their sighs to you extend,
And sweetens, in the suffering pangs it bears,
And true to bondage would not break from thence,
And was my own fee-simple, not in part,
And when in his fair parts she did abide,
And, privileged by age, desires to know
And, veil'd in them, did win whom he would maim:
Appear to him, as he to me appears,
Applied to cautels, all strange forms receives,
Are errors of the blood, none of the mind;
As compound love to physic your cold breast.
As oft 'twixt May and April is to see,
As often shrieking undistinguish'd woe,
As they did battery to the spheres intend;
Ask'd their own wills, and made their wills obey.
Ay me! I fell; and yet do question make
Believed her eyes when they to assail begun,
Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud;
Big discontent so breaking their contents.
Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath.
But kept cold distance, and did thence remove,
But with the inundation of the eyes
But yield them up where I myself must render,
By blunting us to make our wits more keen.
By how much of me their reproach contains.
Came for additions; yet their purposed trim
Catching all passions in his craft of will:
Consents bewitch'd, ere he desire, have granted;
Could 'scape the hail of his all-hurting aim,
Counsel may stop awhile what will not stay;
Crack'd many a ring of posied gold and bone
Cried 'O false blood, thou register of lies,
Demand of him, nor being desired yielded;
Did livery falseness in a pride of truth.
Each cheek a river running from a fount
Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.
Effects of terror and dear modesty,
Encamp'd in hearts, but fighting outwardly.
Enswathed, and seal'd to curious secrecy.
Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
Even there resolved my reason into tears;
Experience for me many bulwarks builded
Feeling it break, with bleeding groans they pine;
Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me
Finding myself in honour so forbid,
For fear of harms that preach in our behoof.
For feasts of love I have been call'd unto,
For his advantage still did wake and sleep:
For maiden-tongued he was, and thereof free;
For on his visage was in little drawn
For she was sought by spirits of richest coat,
For some, untuck'd, descended her sheaved hat,
For these, of force, must your oblations be,
For thou art all, and all things else are thine.
For when we rage, advice is often seen
Found yet moe letters sadly penn'd in blood,
Fresh to myself, If I had self-applied
FROM off a hill whose concave womb reworded
Hallow'd with sighs that burning lungs did raise;
Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;
Harm have I done to them, but ne'er was harm'd;
Have emptied all their fountains in my well,
Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity,
He had the dialect and different skill,
he makes!'
He preach'd pure maid, and praised cold chastity.
Heard where his plants in others' orchards grew,
Her grievance with his hearing to divide:
Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,
His phoenix down began but to appear
His poison'd me, and mine did him restore.
His real habitude gave life and grace
His rudeness so with his authorized youth
How coldly those impediments stand forth
I have received from many a several fair,
I might as yet have been a spreading flower,
I strong o'er them, and you o'er me being strong,
If best were as it was, or best without.
If that from him there may be aught applied
In bloodless white and the encrimson'd mood;
In brief the grounds and motives of her woe.
In clamours of all size, both high and low.
In either's aptness, as it best deceives,
In personal duty, following where he haunted:
In the small orb of one particular tear!
In thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine,
Ink would have seem'd more black and damned here!'
Kept hearts in liveries, but mine own was free,
Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling;
Laundering the silken figures in the brine
Lending soft audience to my sweet design,
Let it not tell your judgment I am old;
Like fools that in th' imagination set
Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
Like usury, applying wet to wet,
Love lack'd a dwelling, and made him her place;
Love made them not: with acture they may be,
Love to myself and to no love beside.
Love's arms are peace, 'gainst rule, 'gainst sense,
Must for your victory us all congest,
My spirits to attend this double voice accorded,
My woeful self, that did in freedom stand,
Nature hath charged me that I hoard them not,
Nor youth all quit; but, spite of heaven's fell rage,
Not age, but sorrow, over me hath power:
Not one whose flame my heart so much as warm'd,
Not to be tempted, would she be immured,
O appetite, from judgment stand aloof!
O cleft effect! cold modesty, hot wrath,
O most potential love! vow, bond, nor space,
O, all that borrow'd motion seeming owed,
O, how the channel to the stream gave grace!
O, that false fire which in his cheek so glow'd,
O, that forced thunder from his heart did fly,
O, that sad breath his spongy lungs bestow'd,
Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,
Of burning blushes, or of weeping water,
Of court, of city, and had let go by
Of folded schedules had she many a one,
Of grief and blushes, aptly understood
Of lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign'd;
Of one by nature's outwards so commended,
Of paled pearls and rubies red as blood;
Of pensived and subdued desires the tender,
Of proofs new-bleeding, which remain'd the foil
Of stale example? When thou wilt inflame,
Of this false jewel, and his amorous spoil.
Of wealth, of filial fear, law, kindred, fame!
Of young, of old; and sexes both enchanted,
Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,
Or any of my leisures ever charm'd:
Or forced examples, 'gainst her own content,
Or he his manage by the well-doing steed.
Or monarch's hands that let not bounty fall
Or my affection put to the smallest teen,
Or sister sanctified, of holiest note;
Or swooning paleness; and he takes and leaves,
Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows.
Pieced not his grace, but were all graced by him.
Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves?
Playing the place which did no form receive,
Proclaim'd in her a careless hand of pride
Proud of subjection, noble by the sway,
Religious love put out Religion's eye:
Reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower.
Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling;
She that her fame so to herself contrives,
She was new lodged and newly deified.
Shook off my sober guards and civil fears;
Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;
Since I their altar, you enpatron me.
So slides he down upon his grained bat,
Some beauty peep'd through lattice of sear'd age.
Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,
Sometime a blusterer, that the ruffle knew
Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied
Sometimes her levell'd eyes their carriage ride,
Storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain.
Sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart.
Take all these similes to your own command,
Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,
Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them:
That flame through water which their hue encloses.
That is, to you, my origin and ender;
That maidens' eyes stuck over all his face:
That season'd woe had pelleted in tears,
That shall prefer and undertake my troth.'
That th' unexperient gave the tempter place,
That we must curb it upon others' proof;
That's to ye sworn to none was ever said;
The accident which brought me to her eye
The aloes of all forces, shocks, and fears.
The broken bosoms that to me belong
The carcass of beauty spent and done:
The deep-green emerald, in whose fresh regard
The destined ill she must herself assay?
The goodly objects which abroad they find
The heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend
The injury of many a blasting hour,
The mind and sight distractedly commix'd.
The naked and concealed fiend he cover'd;
The one a palate hath that needs will taste,
The scars of battle 'scapeth by the flight,
The swiftest hours, observed as they flew--
The thing we have not, mastering what not strives,
Their distract parcels in combined sums.
Their kind acceptance weepingly beseech'd,
Their view right on; anon their gazes lend
There my white stole of chastity I daff'd,
These often bathed she in her fluxive eyes,
They sought their shame that so their shame did find;
This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,
Though Reason weep, and cry, 'It is thy last.'
Though slackly braided in loose negligence.
Thought characters and words merely but art,
Threw my affections in his charmed power,
Till now did ne'er invite, nor never woo.
Till thus he gan besiege me: 'Gentle maid,
Time had not scythed all that youth begun,
To appertainings and to ornament,
To be forbod the sweets that seem so good,
To blush at speeches rank to weep at woes,
To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain
To every place at once, and, nowhere fix'd,
To leave the battery that you make 'gainst mine,
To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep,
To put the by-past perils in her way?
To serve their eyes, and in it put their mind;
To spend her living in eternal love.
To the orbed earth; sometimes they do extend
Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew,
Upon her head a platted hive of straw,
Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls.
Upon the moment did her force subdue,
Upon whose weeping margent she was set;
Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend;
What breast so cold that is not warmed here?
What I should do again for such a sake.
What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn.
What me your minister, for you obeys,
What rocky heart to water will not wear?
What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop
What unapproved witness dost thou bear!
What with his art in youth, and youth in art,
What's sweet to do, to do will aptly find:
When he again desires her, being sat,
When he most burn'd in heart-wish'd luxury,
When winds breathe sweet, untidy though they be.
Where neither party is nor true nor kind:
Where want cries some, but where excess begs all.
Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw
Whereto his invised properties did tend;
Whether the horse by him became his deed,
Which fortified her visage from the sun,
Which late her noble suit in court did shun,
Which like a cherubin above them hover'd.
Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage,
Which on it had conceited characters,
Which one by one she in a river threw,
Which she perused, sigh'd, tore, and gave the flood;
Who glazed with crystal gate the glowing roses
Who, disciplined, ay, dieted in grace,
Who, young and simple, would not be so lover'd?
Whose bare out-bragg'd the web it seem'd to wear:
Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote;
Whose sights till then were levell'd on my face;
Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise;
With brinish current downward flow'd apace:
With objects manifold: each several stone,
With safest distance I mine honour shielded:
With sleided silk feat and affectedly
With the annexions of fair gems enrich'd,
With twisted metal amorously impleach'd,
With wit well blazon'd, smiled or made some moan.
Works under you; and to your audit comes
Would yet again betray the fore-betray'd,
Yet show'd his visage by that cost more dear;
Yet, if men moved him, was he such a storm
